Tweet something whenever your favorite team goes on the Power Play!

Requires Twython
```
pip3 install Twython
```


File keys.py must be created in root folder. Define the following variables in keys.py:
```
consumer_key = 'KEY'
consumer_secret = 'SECRET'
access_token = 'TOKEN'
access_token_secret = 'SECRET'
```
TODO:

- Allow for team name to be passed in via command line option.
- Allow for text file of pre-made tweets to be passed in via command line option.

The above should make the program slimmer and more useable for non Vegas Golden Knights fans.
